# meteor-scoop-bucket

This is a scoop (https://scoop.sh) bucket for the installation of meteor (https://meteor.com).

Use it as follows:

1. Add the bucket
```
 scoop bucket add meteor https://github.com/scyv/meteor-scoop-bucket
```

2. Install meteor
```
 scoop install meteor
```
The installation takes a while, because there are many files within the archive. So be patient. We do NOT recommend to deactivate Windows Defender, which may considerably increase the extraction...
